## 🧠 100x-Alpha-Go: Prompt Vault

Welcome to **100x-Alpha-Go** — a centralized repository to store and share powerful, high-impact prompts tailored to your specific use cases.

### 📁 Structure Guidelines

To maintain consistency and make this repository scalable and easy to browse, please follow this structure:

1. **Create a folder with your name or handle**
   Example:

   ```
   /your-name/
   ```

2. **Add your prompt(s) inside the folder**
   Each prompt can be in a separate `.md` or `.txt` file, or grouped logically.

   Example structure:

   ```
   /your-name/
     ├── startup-idea-generator.md
     ├── resume-enhancer.md
     └── ai-marketing-campaign.md
   ```

3. **Optional**: Include a short README in your folder describing the purpose of your prompts.
